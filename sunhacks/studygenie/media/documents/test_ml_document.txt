        Machine Learning Fundamentals
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn 
        and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.
        
        Key Types:
        1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled training data
        2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
        3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through trial and error
        
        Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and clustering.
        Applications span from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.
